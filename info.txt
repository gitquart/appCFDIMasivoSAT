PYINSTALLER & PYGUBU-DESIGNER
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

1)To open pygubu-designer, just type "pygubu-designer" in terminal.
2)Tutorial to create a python executable file: https://datatofish.com/executable-pyinstaller/
When running the pyinstaller (works very well indeed) it will create in the same folder of the file to convert to exe the following files/folders:


Commands: 

pyinstaller --onefile {fileNameOfExe}.py -n {nameOfExecutable}
       
/build
/dist/yourfile.exe
yourfile.spec

If you find any troubles when opening your executable of python, open it in terminal
by just "yourfile.exe" or drag exe file in terminal (MS-DOS) and hit Enter and it will show you the problems.
In my case it was missing "cfdiclient" module, so I just reinstall the requirements.txt in my system and I restarted because the module was already installed but the exe could not read it. Once restarted, it worked.

ERRORS:

1) No module found...
Solution: Generate again the requirements.txt from environment (pip freeze > requirements.txt)

2) Seems that "No module found" error comes when making executable without "Virtual Environment" turned on.

2)The python wrapper for SAT Massive download works well, take a look on the warnings:
WARNINGS (Based on chat with Herbert Pe√±a)
W1) Sometimes SAT Services is DEAD or answers weird things, its A SERVICE PROBLEM, ON THEIR SIDE.
W2) The PAQ (Such as Compaq) they USE ANOTHER WAY WITH ALREADY A RELATION WITH SAT, THEY HAVE OTHER WAYS TO COMMUNICATE WITH SAT SERVICE (PRIVATE CHANNELS, WITH MORE POWER, BANDWIDTH)
W3) The steps shown on the video lessons are OLD (10 YEARS OLD).

Conclusion: Normal WEB SERVICE will never work as well as PRIVATE CHANNELS.
