1)To open pygubu-designer, just type "pygubu-designer" in terminal.
2)Tutorial to create a python executable file: https://datatofish.com/executable-pyinstaller/
When running the pyinstaller (works very well indeed) it will create in the same folder of the file to convert to exe the following files/folders:


Commands: 

pyinstaller --onefile {fileNameOfExe}.py -n {nameOfExecutable}
       
/build
/dist/yourfile.exe
yourfile.spec

If you find any troubles when opening your executable of python, open it in terminal
by just "yourfile.exe" or drag exe file in terminal (MS-DOS) and hit Enter and it will show you the problems.
In my case it was missing "cfdiclient" module, so I just reinstall the requirements.txt in my system and I restarted because the module was already installed but the exe could not read it. Once restarted, it worked.

ERRORS:

1) No module found...
Solution: Generate again the requirements.txt from environment (pip freeze > requirements.txt)

2) Seems that "No module found" error comes when making executable without Environment on.
