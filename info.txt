1)To open pygubu-designer, just type "pygubu-designer" in terminal.
2)Tutorial to create a python executable file: https://datatofish.com/executable-pyinstaller/
When running the pyinstaller (works very well indeed) it will create in the same folder of the file to convert to exe the following files/folders:


Commands: 

pyinstaller --onefile {fileNameOfExe}.py
       
/build
/dist/yourfile.exe
yourfile.spec

If you find any troubles when opening your executable of python, open it in terminal
by just "yourfile.exe" or drag exe file in terminal (MS-DOS) and hit Enter and it will show you the problems.
In my case it was missing "cfdiclient" module, so I just reinstall the requirements.txt in my system and I restarted because the module was already installed but the exe could not read it. Once restarted, it worked.


Info about experience with CFDI program (Python API's)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. When a request is made it delivers an ID, we wait 10 mins (for example) to wait to verify this ID, in this way
no test has failed. It failed because we didn't give time to the webservice to process the request (assumption)
2. By several tests, we see that Final date is not shown, this means, the request takes record from start date to final date, but not included the final date.
