1)To open pygubu-designer, just type "pygubu-designer" in terminal.
2)Tutorial to create a python executable file: https://datatofish.com/executable-pyinstaller/
When running the pyinstaller (works very well indeed) it will create in the same folder of the file to convert to exe the following files/folders:

/build
/dist/yourfile.exe
yourfile.spec

If you find any troubles when opening your executable of python, open it in terminal
by just "yourfile.exe" Enter and it will show you the problems.
In my case it was missing a library.
