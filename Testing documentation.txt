Info about experience with CFDI program (Python API's)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
General testing.
------------------
1.The first part is to get a (solicitarDescarga) "ID SOLICITUD", then to "Verificar Solicitud".
  "VERIFICAR_SOLICITUD" gets the "ID packages" which means it has CFDI to downloadd, if CFDI is zero then NO PACKAGES, NO ZIP TO DONWLOAD.
2. The "SOLICITUD_ID" is processed maybe after 4 or 5 minutes, the program is set with 8 minutes, if we receiced and ACCEPTED WITH NO CFDI
answer it doesn't mean after some "X" minutes it will be proccesed, we had this experience with a request with State 5000 (Accepted),
we waited for 30 mins and it was still in the same state 5000.
3. For date ranges the last date is EXCLUSIVE, this means, if the range is 1 july 2020 to 1 august 2020, this example will take JULY COMPLETE.

TESTING 13/08/2021
-------------------
1. The executable for clients work very good, the problem is still the communcation with service which we suppose it's not well made.
2. The API wich checks the STATE of each xml works good, tested with 5 K files in a row
